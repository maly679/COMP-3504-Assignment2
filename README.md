# Inventory Tracking System

This application is designed to view all the items currently in inventory and add an item missing from inventory.

This will enable the app to properly load and display all the current items currently in inventory. 

### Viewing the metadata of an item

- The app will take you to a new window, displaying the item\'s ID, name, quantity, price, and supplier\'s ID.
- To return to the main page, click on the back arrow.

### Adding an item to inventory
- To add an new item to inventory, click on the button on the bottom of the screen \"Add Item to Inventory\".
- This will take you to a new window where you can add the item and input its ID, name, quantity, price, and supplier\'s ID.
- Once you are satisified with the edit, click \"Add Item\".
- If you change your mind and want to return to the main page, click on \"Return to Main Page\" or the back button.


## Notable Bugs
There is a bug in the app\'s main page where the list of items is not rendered initially. To get the list of items to show on the page, first, type a character into the search field, then erase said character to render all the items in inventory.
